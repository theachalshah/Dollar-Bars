# Dollar-Bars

The number of shares traded is a function of the actual value exchanged. Therefore, it makes sense sampling bars in terms of dollar value exchanged. “Dollar bars” refer to a type of financial charting technique where bars or candles are plotted based on the value of a fixed dollar amount of price movement, rather than time or time, tick or value intervals.
